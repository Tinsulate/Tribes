# Tribes
A game of social standing, comppetition and cooperation.


Tribes: gathering is a multiplayer game where players try to survive and thrive as tribe
and improve their position in it. As the players help the tribe overcome various challenges they contribute to the
unique story of their tribe.

While many other society-building games focus on technological, infrastructural and/or character building, the main theme
of this game is the exploring of social roles, social standing and emergent social behaviour inside a community of humans.
